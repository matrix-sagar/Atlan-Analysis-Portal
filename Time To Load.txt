To calculate the time required for page load:
We calculated the time difference between the events when App.vue was 'created' and when
App.vue was 'mounted'
The function to calculate this has been done in the App.vue file using methods
- created()
- mounted()
and the difference is then passed to HeaderBar.vue as a prop namely (timeTakenToLoad).
The HeaderBar displays this data along with website logo.
